          "With over a decade of creative and strategic experience across photography, video production, branding, and marketing, I bring a rare blend of hands-on production expertise and conceptual vision. My background spans everything from feature film and fashion photography to startup brand development and AI-enhanced marketing strategy — all anchored by a deep understanding of storytelling and audience connection.",
          "As Creative Director at AiPhlo (formerly Digital Graffiti Media Co.), I've led full-scale brand initiatives integrating design, social media management, SEO/SEM/MPO strategy, and scalable content production. I've developed campaigns for both emerging and established brands, directing creative teams, overseeing video and still production, and delivering organic engagement and measurable growth.",
          "I've worked across every phase of content development: concepting, shooting, editing, and managing rollout strategy. Beyond production, I bring an advanced awareness of modern marketing ecosystems — including AI-driven tools, data-integrated campaigns, and algorithmic audience mapping.",
          "What drives me most is crafting meaningful, resonant visual stories — whether it's a brand launch, a digital campaign, or a cinematic shoot. I'm at my best when I can unite art and analytics to create content that looks beautiful and performs effectively.",
          "I'd love the opportunity to bring this mix of creativity, leadership, and strategy to your team.",
